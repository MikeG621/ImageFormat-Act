The .ACT file is primarily used for backdrops and explosion graphics in TIE95
and XvT/BoP. The ACT format is also used in the XACT LFD Resource, although
this seems to be deprecated in TIE95 in favor of separate *.ACT files.

For the purpose of this document, the use of *.ACT files will be assumed. To
use for XACTs, add the standard LFD header information.

ACT Structure Details

Yet another graphics format for the X-wing series; I think for TIE95 this is my
7th graphic write-up. This format borrows from some of the other formats, which
makes sense seeing that this came around later. The ACT is capable of holding
multiple images like the ANIM and uses some of the same header info, and the
pixel data is stored much like PANL.

The file iself is broken into a few sections. The first is the FileHeader of a
fixed size. Next is a half section, the jump table, which is really nothing
more than a few INT offsets pointing to each frame. The list is only as long as
it needs to be, so if there's only one image, there's only one offset.
FrameOffset[0] = FrameOffsetsJump
FrameOffset[i] = FrameOffset[i-1] + Frame[i-1].FrameLength
or
&Frame[i] = FrameOffsetsJump + FrameOffset[i]

The remaining section is the Frames, which contain all of the image data.

There is also the possibility of a Global Colors section, although I've never
seen it actually used.  Technically speaking, the jump values allow everything
after the FileHeader to be in a jumbled order, so I don't know if the Global
Colors would typically appear before or after the Frames, or how they interact
with the Frame colors when it comes to index usage if they're both used.

-- FileHeader --

To start it off we have the Length value, which for an *.ACT file is just the
filesize, simple enough. TotalColorCount is the sum of ColorCount values from
all frames. The GlobalColorsJump is the offset to that array if used. The
FrameOffsetsJump is a jump to the FrameOffsets and usually FileHeader.Length.
The Reserved value is overwritten in-game, so this is typically left as 0.
FrameCount is one-indexed, nothing fancy there. ImageWidth and ImageHeight
however are zero-indexed, so add 1 to get the true size. The Center values
define the pixel used to "pin" the image at a location. Typically they're just
the Width and Height divided in half. The UseGlobalColors is typically 00 to
denote they're not used, but otherwise would need to be 0x18. That would be
followed by the GlobalColorCount if used, usually zero.

-- Frame --

Frames have a header of their own, starting off with the expected FrameLength
and FrameColorsJump values. Similar to the FileHeader, it is a jump to the
FrameColors and usually FrameHeader.Length. ImageDataJump is the jump value to
the frame extents and the standard value is below.
ImageDataJump = 0x2C + ColorCount * 4

Reserved is again an in-game value, but is typically the FrameLength value
repeated. It's followed by the frame's pixel dimensions, (one-indexed). The
frame can have a size smaller than the entire image.

LengthBitCount is handy value, and the concept was taken from cockpit PANL
image data. This will be explained in detail near the end. Frame colors are
normally used, so that value will be 0x18. ColorCount gives the number of
Colors defined in the Frame. Nothing tricky.

The Color values should be simple enough, each frame contains a palette of
24-bit RGB values. Color[0] is always treated as transparent, so the actual
color is moot.

The FrameLeft and FrameTop values are really there if the frame size is smaller
than the image size, and the image is not intended to be displayed centered.
Usually the values are very close to -(FrameWidth/2) and -(FrameHeight/2).
The FrameRight value just makes up the difference, and Top is repeated for some
reason.

-- Row --

Now we're into the actual pixel data. This is mostly the same as PANL image
compression methods, and where Shift can come to play. But first, the special
OpCode values. The FC (Blank) op code is slightly different from PANL, in that
it only takes one argument, NumRepeat. The ColorIndex value is always zero. FD
(Repeat) however is the same, and requires both NumRepeat and ColorIndex in
that order. FE is still EndRow, and FF is similarly EndFrame.

The pixel data is stored right-to-left, bottom to top, so a FlipXY is required
if you're reading the pixels normally. Idmr.ImageFormat.Act.dll takes this into
account so what you import is what you see in-game.

FB (Shift) is a new op code. It takes one SHORT argument, IndexShift. Although
it's a 16-bit value, in reality the second byte is truncated so it's in effect
a BYTE IndexShift and an unused value that should be zero. This might have
played a part with the Global colors, as I've seen evidence that it was not
limited to 256 colors. The IndexShift value is added to the Index value of all
following Short codes until replaced and the resulting value is used as the
Short's new Index value. Now, this op code technically allows high-Index values
to use the Short codes, but it actually hurts compression for most images, as
this method uses four bytes per operation, when using the Repeat code only
takes up three bytes.

The LengthBitCount value comes into play for all other codes, designated as
Short codes. Unlike PANL which only has two bits for NumRepeat, the BitCount
determines how many bits can be used for that value. A BitCount value of 03
will allow 1-8 pixels while a vlue of 04 will allow 1-16 pixels. Short codes
can only be used for ColorIndex values of (1<<(8-BitCount))-1. If ColorCount is
higher, especially when using 256 colors, then the Repeat code should be used
for all ColorIndex values 0x10 and up for BitCount 04, 0x20 and up for BitCount
03. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the Shift op code can be used to
extend the Short code's range, but for the sake of filesize compression the
Repeat code is better.

You'll note that in the Row definition, OpCode[] is of an undefined size. This
is the only portion of the file that cannot be determined without iteration,
both the total byte length and number of OpCodes. The true count of each code
is NumRepeat+1 (as NumRepeat is zero-indexed), and the sum of all codes in a
row will equal Frame.Width.
